PREFACE.


The innumerable readers of MERRY'S MUSEUM will here meet with
many familiar faces, lighted up by pleasant smiles, and hear the same
old jovial laughter that greeted them in the olden time.

Our motto is that of our noble State--"EXCELSIOR!"
Our readers will see that we have not buried the talents of our
contributors in napkins--but seek to bring them out into the bright
day: For Genius--like the lamp of Aladdin--needs constant polishing to
bring out its lustre and full effect.

Our object has been to instruct by smiles--not frowns; to cheer the
dear hearts of the young girlhood and boyhood; to strew flowers among
the necessary thorns of existence. In a word, we try in these pages to
make the sad happy--the happy still happier.

Hence, pure fun will be found as beautiful in these pages, as honey
amid the flowers of Hybla.

  ROBERT MERRY.




      Robert Merry to his friends
      A kindly greeting sends,
  With a general assortment of questions,
      Conundrums, Charades,
      Puzzles, Riddles of all shades,
      And Rebuses, as aids
  To intellectual and social digestion.

      If the young Merry host
      Acquaintance should boast,
  Or kindred, or authorship pat,
      With some of our jokes,
      We confess--('tis no hoax)--
      To amuse other folks,
  We have _riddled_ the Museum "Chat."

      Now we beg you will show,
      If you happen to know,
  Why the Editor, painstaking soul?
      Is like the cold storm
      Which, in climates bright and warm,
      Where gallinippers swarm,
  Come shivering down from the pole?

They each have four sons, and each divides the remainder among his
sons in such a way that each son will share equally with his brother,
and in similar shape. How were the two farms divided?

12. What is that which is often brought to table, often cut, but never
eaten?

13.

  My first is four-sixths of a step that is long,
    My second is a person of state;
  My whole is a thing that is known to be wrong,
    And is a strong symptom of hate.

14. Why are your nose and chin always at variance?

15.

  Without my first you can not stand,
  My second beauteous fair command;
  Together I attend your will,
  And am your humble servant still.

16. Why ought a fisherman to be very wealthy?

17. Why is a man in debt like a misty morning?

18. Who was the first that bore arms?

19. There is a word of seven letters; the first two refers to man, the
first three refers to woman, the first four signifies a great man, the
seven a great woman.

20. I am a word of five letters. Take away my first and I am the name
of what adorns the estate of many of the nobility of England. Take
away my first and second, and I am the name of a place where all the
world was once congregated. Take away my last, and I am the name of
a beautiful mineral. Take away my two last, and I am the name of a
fashionable place of resort. I am small in stature, but capable of
doing a great deal of mischief, as I once did in London in the year
1666.

21. Spell eye-water four letters.

22. Why is swearing like an old coat?

23. Why is a thump like a hat?

24. Why is an inn like a burial-ground?

27. If a fender cost six dollars, what will a ton of coal come to?

28. What word is that to which if you add a syllable, it will make it
shorter?

29.

  My first is a very uncomfortable state,
  In cold weather it mostly abounds.
  My second's an instrument formed of hard steel,
  That will cause the stout foe to stagger and reel,
  And when used, is a symptom of hate.
  My whole is an author of greatest renown,
  Whose fame to the last day of time will go down.

30. What is the longest and yet the shortest thing in the world;
the swiftest and yet the slowest; the most divisible and the most
extended; the least valued and the most regretted; without which
nothing can be done; which devours every thing, however small, and yet
gives life and spirits to every object, however great?

31.

  My first is found in every house,
    From wintry winds it guards.
  My second is the highest found--
    In every pack of cards.
  My whole, a Scottish chief, is praised
    By ballad, bard, and story,
  Who for his country gave his life,
    And, dying, fell with glory.

32. Why are handsome women like bread?

33. Why is an avaricious man like one with a short memory?

34. What river in Bavaria answers the question, Who is there?

35. Why is a man with wooden legs like one who has an even bargain?

36.

[Illustration]

37.

[Illustration]

38. Why is a parish bell like a good story?

39. What belongs to yourself, yet is used by others more than
yourself?

40.

  In camps about the centre I appear;
  In smiling meadows seen throughout the year;
  The silent angler views me in the streams,
  And all must trace me in their morning dreams,
  First in the mob conspicuous I stand,
  Proud of the lead, and ever in command.

41. The head of a whale is six feet long; his tail is as long as his
head and half his body, and his body is half of his whole length. How
long is the whale?

42. A hundred stones are placed, in a straight line, a yard distant
from each other. How many yards must a person walk, who undertakes to
pick them up, and place them in a basket stationed one yard from the
first stone?

43.

  My first is a part of the day,
    My last a conductor of light,
  My whole to take measure of time,
    Is useful by day and by night.

44. I am a word of three syllables, each of which is a word; my
first is an article in common use; my second, an animal of uncommon
intelligence; my third, though not an animal, is used in carrying
burdens. My whole is a useful art.

45.

  There was a man who was _not_ born,
    His father was _not_ born before him,
  He, did _not_ live, he did _not_ die,
    And his epitaph is _not_ o'er him.

46. Why is a nail, fast in the wall, like an old man?

47. Why does a miller wear a white hat?

48.

[Illustration]

49.

[Illustration]

50.

  My first is a letter commanding to wed,
  Or to lift your sole till it reaches your head;
  Nothing worth as a whole, it is plain to all men
  That divided in halves, it is equal to ten;

  My second, though nothing, compared to the other,
  Is worth more as a partner than its double-faced brother;
  It moans and it sighs, and when joined to my first,
  Pronounces the doom of the sinner accursed.

  My third, you will find his whole value depends
  On the worth and position of neighbors and friends,
  And, when both the other two following fair,
  Changes doom to desire, and a curse to a prayer.

  My fourth, though it formeth no part of a hundred,
  Shows where it can justly and evenly be sundered;
  'Tis found in the elements everywhere present,
  'Tis found in all seasons, unpleasant or pleasant,
  'Tis the chief of all lands, and yet can not wait
  On continent, hemisphere, empire, or state.
  Though ne'er in Great Britain suspected to lower,
  'Tis the heart of each quarter of that mighty power;
  It always belonged to the animal race,
  In the mineral kingdom they gave it a place,
  And, being impartial, they could not deny,
  The vegetable order its virtue to try;
  And yet, since creation, it never was known
  In beast, bird, or fish, root, branch, stem, or stone.

  My whole you'll find growing in pasture and barns,
  Or grown in coats, carpets, warm blankets, and yarns,
  In England, in Saxony, France, and old Wales,
  And in sundry more places it always prevails.
  Of quadrupedal origin--still it is known
  In bipedal families oft to be shown;
  But the strangest of all its strange forms, and conditions
  Is seen in the covering of sage politicians.

53. What is that which is invisible, but never out of sight?

54. When is a boat like a knife?

56. How many black beans will make five white ones?

57. Why is a dandy like a haunch of venison?

58. What kin is that child to its father who is not its father's own
son?

59. Why is a rose-bud like a promissory note?

60. What biblical name is there which expresses a father calling his
son by name, and his son replying?

61. Why is an orange not like a church bell?

62. Why is the largest city in Ireland likely to be the largest city
in the world?

63.

  Three-fourths of a cross, and a circle complete,
  An upright where two semicircles meet,
  A rectangle triangle standing on feet,
  Two semicircles, and a circle complete.

64. What smells most in a drug shop?

65. Why should doctors attend to window-sashes?

66. G. a. p/A.

it has been divided?

68. Spell hard water with three letters.

69. What letters of the alphabet come too late for supper?

70.

[Illustration]

71.

[Illustration]

72.

  Pronounced as one letter, and written with three,
  Two letters there are, and two only in me;
  I'm double, I'm single, I'm black, blue, and gray,
  I am read from both ends, and the same either way,
  I am restless and wandering, steady and fixed,
  And you know not one hour what I may be the next.
  I melt, and I kindle--beseech, and defy,
  I am watery and moist, I am fiery and dry.
  I am scornful and scowling, compassionate, meek;
  I am light, I am dark, I am strong, I am weak.
  I'm piercing and clean, I am heavy and dull;
  Expressive and languid, contracted and full.
  I'm a globe and a mirror, a window, a door,
  An index, an organ, and fifty things more.
  I belong to all animals under the sun,
  And to those who were long understood to have none.
  My language is plain, though it can not be heard,
  And I speak without even pronouncing a word.
  Some call me a diamond--some say I am jet;
  Others talk of my water, or how I am set.
  I'm a borough in England, in Scotland a stream,
  And an isle of the sea in the Irishman's dream.
  The earth without me would no loveliness wear,
  And sun, moon, and stars at my wish disappear.
  Yet so frail is my tenure, so brittle my joy,
  That a speck gives me pain, and a drop can destroy.

73. What vessel is that which is always asking leave to move?

74. Translate the following into Latin--

  42, 8 rocks, e e e e e e e e e e, 46. 2. 14. 8. 0.

75. How is it that you can work with an awl, but not with a forceps;
while I can work with a forceps, and not with an awl?

76.

  _Add_, was the word the master gave to Dick,
  Dick scratched his head, and looking rather thick,
  Replied, "_Hereafter it would make it stick_."
  "Dick," cried the master, "rudeness is a sin;
  Behold the stocks, I'll surely put you _in_."
  "That," answered Dick, "won't alter it a feather,
  _Hereafter it would make it hold together_."
  "Dick," said the man, "if you insult me so,
  Your shoulders and my rod I'll put in _Co._"
  "'Tis all the same," said Dick, "my worthy master,
  _Hereafter it would make it stick the faster_."

78. Why is France like a skeleton?

79. Why is a woodman like a stage actor?

80. Why is the hour of noon on the dial-plate like a pair of
spectacles?

81. Why is the best baker most in want of bread?

82.

  Whether old Homer tippled wine or beer,
  Julep or cider, history is not clear;
  But plain it is--the bard, though wont to roam,
  But for one liquid, never had left home.

83. Why is a coward like a mouse-trap?

84. Why is green grass like a mouse?

85. What two reasons why whispering in company is not proper?

86.

  My first is found on the ocean wave,
    In the spring, the pit, and the mine;
  My second below earth's surface you have,
    Where seldom the sun can shine.
  My whole your dinner-table must grace,
  And seldom fails to obtain a place.

87. Why is a gooseberry pie like counterfeit money?

88.

[Illustration]

89. Why does a fisherman blow his horn?

90. Why is there no danger of starving in a desert?

91.

  Take half of the needle
    By which sailors steer
  Their ship through the water,
    Be it cloudy or clear;
  Do not really break it--
    This of all things were worst--
  But in your mind take it,
    And this makes my first.
  At thanksgiving or Christmas,
    My second you see;
  With care well compounded,
    From grain, shrub, and tree.
  My whole like some people
    Who make great pretense,
  Of words have a plenty,
    But no great stock of sense.

92. How is it that Methuselah was the oldest man, when he died before
his father?

93.

  My first is a negative greatly in use,
  By which people begin when they mean to refuse;
  My second is Fashion, or so called in France,
  But, like other whims, is the servant of chance.
  An article always in use is my whole,
  With texture and form under fashion's control;
  But, alas! not a thing can it see which goes by,
  Although many have four sights, and all have one eye.

94. What is that which, supposing its greatest breadth to be four
inches, length nine inches, and depth three inches, contains a solid
foot?

95.

[Illustration]

96.

  My tongue is long, my breath is strong,
    And yet I breed no strife;
  My voice you hear both far and near,
    And yet I have no life.

97. A waterman rows a given distance, _a_, and back again in _b_
hours, and finds that he can row _c_ miles with the current, for
_d_ miles against it. Required, the time of rowing down, the time of
rowing up, the rate of current, and the rate of rowing.

98.

  As I was beating on the far east grounds,
  Up starts a hare before my two greyhounds;
  The dogs, being light of foot, did fairly run,
  To her fifteen rods, just twenty-one;
  And the distance that she started up before,
  Was six-and-ninety rods, just and no more;
  Now, I would have you Merry boys declare
  How far they ran, before they caught the hare.

99. Is it possible to put twelve pieces of money in six rows, and have
four in a row?

100. A gentleman sent a servant with a present of nine ducks, with
this direction--

  "To Alderman Gobble, with ix. ducks."

The servant took out three, and contrived it so that the direction
corresponded with the number of the ducks. He neither erased nor
altered a letter. How did he do it?

101.

  Four letters form me quite complete,
    As all who breathe do show;
  Reversed, you'll find I am the seat
    Of infamy and woe.
  Transposed, you'll see I'm base and mean,
    Again of Jewish race;
  Transposed once more, I oft am seen
    To hide a lovely face.

102.

[Illustration]

103.

  My first is the name to an article given
  For ladies and dandies to put on their linen;
  It comes from the forest, I've heard people say,
  And is made from the skin of an animal gay.
  My second is a fruit that comes from the South,
  The juice of it is sour, and 'twill pucker your mouth;
  'Tis found in candy shops all over the town,
  And, stranger to say, it is almost round.
  My whole is an article that is often seen
  In the gardens and fields almost covered with green;
  It is very sweet, and also pleasant to eat,
  And in hot summer days affords a rich treat.

104. My first is half of what implies good-humor; my second makes
sense of my first; my third sounds like the cry of a kitten; my fourth
is a consonant and vowel combined; my fifth, with the addition of the
initial of my third, would imply silence; and my whole is what many
boys and girls prize highly.

105.

  I am composed of twelve letters.
  My 2, 8, 9, is a substance dug out of the earth.
  "  6, 11, 12, 8, is a numeral.
  "  4, 2, 3, is an ancient instrument of war.
  "  12, 8, 1, is a vessel used in former times.
  "  5, is a vowel.
  "  4, 7, 1, 9, is a hard substance.
  "  10, 9, is a pronoun.
  My whole is now before you.

106. My first is appropriate, my second 'tis nine to one if you guess
it. My whole elevates the sole above the earth.

107. Why is a conundrum like a monkey?

108. What do we all do when we first get into bed?

109.

[Illustration]

110.

[Illustration]

111. There is one word in the English language which is universally
considered a preventive of harm; change a certain letter in it, and
you make it an act of cruelty.

112.

  My first may be fashioned of iron or wood,
    And at window or door for safety is placed;
  In village or town it does more harm than good,
    Leading people their health, time, and money to waste.
  My second's a lady, bewitching and fair,
    And for love of her people will labor and strive;
  Will rise before dawn, and be wearied with care,
    And pursue her with ardor as long as they live.
  My whole is what ladies admire and approve,
    The shopkeeper's boast--the purchaser's prize;
  'Tis a ninepenny chintz--'tis a one-shilling glove--
    It is something which makes people open their eyes.

113. At what distance must a body have fallen to acquire the velocity
of 1,600 feet per second?

114. Of what trade is the sun in May?

115. Why is a small horse like a young musk-melon?

116.

  My first must grace a legal deed,
    With its companion, firm and red;
  Its help in marriage, too, they need,
    Before the blessing can be said.
  My second half a hundred is,
    If in the shortest way you spell;
  You soon must guess me after this,
    I may as well the secret tell.
  My whole, by his celestial strains
    Bears the rapt soul to worlds above;
  The Great Creator's power proclaims,
    And tells of the Redeemer's love.

117.

[Illustration]

118.

[Illustration]

119. My first is a boy's nickname; my second is meant for defense; my
third is a preposition; my fourth is one of the articles; my fifth is
one of the United States. My whole is a large city in Europe.

120.

      My first is stationed near your heart,
        And serves to brace the mortal frame;
      Of young and old it forms a part,
        And to fair woman gives a name.
      Who builds a ship must it employ,
        To give it strength to stem the flood,
      And Adam felt no real joy
        Till in new form by him it stood.
      My second may be long or short,
        Or tight or loose, or wet or dry,
      Of cotton, silk, or woolen wrought,
        Of any texture, strength, or dye--
      Be made of iron, gold, or steel,
        Of love or hate, of good or ill,
      May gently bind, or heavy feel,
        May give support, or rudely kill.
  My whole is formed by fashion, skill, and care,
  And what few ladies from their dress can spare.

121. How long would a ball be falling, from the top of a tower that
was 400 feet high, to the earth?

122. Why are chairs like men?

123. The foot of a ladder 60 feet long remaining in the same place,
the top will just reach a window 40 feet high on one side of the
street, and another 30 feet high on the other side. How wide is the
street?

124. There is a pile of cannon-balls, the ground tier of which
contains 289 balls, and the top tier one ball. Require the whole
number of balls in a pile.

  What skillful housewife does not know
    When, where to place my first?
  When nicely done, it will not show;
    Conspicuous, it is worst.
  My second all the world must do,
    Either with head or hand,
  In different ways the same pursue,
    On water, or on land.
  My whole a picture is of life,
    Varied with good or ill,
  With bright or dull, with light or dark,
    Arranged with art and skill.

128. What is that which will make you catch cold--cure the cold--and
pay the doctor's bill?

129. Why is a joke like a cocoa-nut?

130. When did Esau, the hairy man, lose his whiskers?

131. Why do postmasters deserve the execration of all true Americans?

132.

  Just equal are my head and tail,
    My middle slender as can be,
  Whether I stand on head or heel,
    'Tis all the same to you or me.
  But if my head should be cut off,
    The matter's true, although 'tis strange,
  My head and body, severed thus,
    Immediately to nothing change.

133. If a loafer, smoking a cigar, sets fire to the brush on his upper
lip, is it a case of spontaneous combustion?

I.

  Go wide o'er the world,
  And everywhere seek me--
  In earth, sea, or air,
  Thou never shalt meet me!
  Go wide o'er the world--
  I always am there--
  Wherever thou roamest,
  In earth, sea, or air!


II.

  Go speak to the woodland,
  And question of me--
  Oh ne'er shall thou find me,
  With forest or tree!
  Go, speak to the woodland,
  I ever am there,
  And live in its whispers,
  Though lighter than air!


III.

  Go, winnow the wave,
  And seek for my breath--
  Ah, ocean and river,
  Reveal but my death!
  Go, winnow the wave,
  Tho' with winter it shiver--
  There--there shalt thou find me,
  'Mid ocean and river!


IV.

  In whirlwinds I revel,
  Yet in zephyrs expire--
  I flourish in warmth,
  And I perish in fire!
  The winter I cherish,
  Yet each season I shun;
  Half living in harvest,
  In summer, undone!


V.

  I come with the warlock--
  I go with the ghoul--
  I shriek with the wizard--
  I hoot with the owl!
  I ride on the hazel
  Which witches have rent--
  I fly on the wing
  Which the eagle hath bent.


VI.

  I come and I go--
  Oft unseen and unsought;
  I live but in words--
  I perish in thought.
  So to all and to each,
  I bid you adieu;
  Yet to all and to each,
  I stay double with you!

  And swiftly through the air I go.

145. Why are two heads better than one?

146. Why is a cart-horse always in the wrong place?

  I scratch and break, but never deal in blows.

150. ARITHMETICAL PUZZLE.--This consists of six slips of
paper or card, on which are written numbers as expressed in the
following columns--

  +----+-+----+-+----+-+----+-+----+-+----+
  |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    |

  | 63 | | 63 | | 63 | | 63 | | 63 | | 63 |
  +----+-+----+-+----+-+----+-+----+-+----+

The slips being thus prepared, a person is to think of any one of
the numbers which they contain, and to give to the expounder of
the question those slips in which the number thought of occurs. To
discover this number, the expounder has nothing to do but to add
together the numbers at the top of the columns put into his hand.
Their sum will express the number thought of.

_Example._--Thus, suppose we think of the number 14. We find that this
number is in three of the slips, viz., those marked B, C, and D, which
are therefore given to the expounder, who, on adding together 2, 4,
and 8, obtains 14, the number thought of.

The trick may be varied in the following manner: Instead of giving to
the expounder the slips containing the number thought of, these may be
kept back, and those in which the number does not occur be given. In
this case, the expounder must add together, as before, the numbers at
the top of the columns, and subtract their sum from 63. The remainder
will be the number thought of.

The slips containing the columns of numbers are usually marked with
letters on the back, and not above the columns, as we have expressed
them. This renders the deception more complete, as the expounder,
knowing beforehand the number at the top of each column, has only
to examine the letters at the back of the slips given him, when he
performs the problem without looking at the numbers, and thus renders
the trick more extraordinary.

151.

  A pair of little quadrupeds,
    Transpose them, and you'll find
  The lords of ocean, or the aids
    For disciplining mind;
  Or that which cheers the midnight hour,
    Or gilds the flagstaff high;
  Now test your transposition power,
    And for the answer try.

152. When is a chair like a rich lady's dress?

153. One _p_, one _i_, four _a_'s, two _r_'s, two _s_'s, two
_l_'s--what do they make, and who has made a fortune by them?

154. What odd number will give, on being divided, a half clear of a
fraction?

155.

  I'm in the book, but not on any leaf;
  I'm in the mouth, but not in lip or teeth;
  I'm in the atmosphere, but never in the air;
  I wait on every one, but never on a pair;
  I am with you wherever you may go;
  And every thing you do I'm sure to know;
  Though when you did it I should not be there,
  Yet when 'twas done, you'd find me in the chair.

156. What is the difference between Joan of Arc and Noah's ark?

157.

  I am composed of seventeen letters.
  My 4, 6, 10, is what we all do.
  "  5, 8, 14, 11, is a great part of the body.
  "  1, 13, 9, 15, is the name of a fish.
  "  7, 16, 2, 10, is a part of speech.
  "  13, 8, 3, is the name of a fowl.
  "  6, 15, 14, is a girl's name.
  "  17, 6, 10, 15, is very useful to vessels.
  "  13, 6, 12, is a personal pronoun.
  My whole is what we may all expect if we live.

158. My first is an instrument, which, though small, has more power
than any monarch on earth. It is the lover's friend and the poet's
pride; yet has overthrown kingdoms, ruined reputations, set folks
together by the ears, and caused more destruction than plagues,
pestilence, or famine. My second, though not quite so mischievous, is
very destructive when in improper hands, and my whole, though employed
against my first, is deemed its friend and improver.

159. This is a most excellent pastime. It should be played in a
spacious place, out of doors, if possible, and the more there are
engaged in it, provided they be of the same height and agility, the
better is the sport. We will suppose a dozen at play:--Let eleven of
them stand in a row, about six yards apart, with all their faces in
one direction, arms folded, or their hands resting on their thighs,
their elbows in, and their heads bent forward, so that the chin of
each rests on his breast, the right foot advanced, the back a little
bent, the shoulders rounded, and the body firm. The last begins the
sport by taking a short run, placing his hands on the shoulders of
the nearest player, and leaping with their assistance--of course,
springing with his feet at the same time--over his head, as
represented in the cut. Having cleared the first, he goes on to the
second, third, fourth, fifth, etc., in succession, and as speedily
as possible. When he has gone over the last, he goes to the proper
distance, and places himself in position for all the players to leap
over him in their turn. The first over whom he passed, follows him
over the second, third, fourth, etc.; and when he has gone over, the
one who begun the game places himself in like manner for the others
to jump over him. The third follows the second, and so on until the
parties are tired.

  His heart was sad, and his foot was sore,
  When a stranger knocked at the cottager's door;
  With travel faint, as the night fell down,
  He had missed his way to the nearest town,
  And he prayed for water to quench his thirst,
  And he showed his purse as he asked for my _first_.
  The cotter was moved by the stranger's tale,
  He spread the board, and he poured the ale:
  "The river," he said, "flows darkly down
  Betwixt your path and the lighted town,
  And far from hence its stream is crossed
  By the bridge on the road that you have lost;
  Gold may not buy, till your weary feet
  Have traversed the river and reached the street,
  The thing you ask; but the wandering moon
  Will be out in the sky with her lantern soon;
  Then cross o'er the meadow, and look to the right,
  And you'll find my _second_ by her light."
  My _second_ shone like a silver floor,
  When the traveler passed from the cotter's door;
  He saw the town on its distant ridge,
  Yet he sighed no more for the far-off bridge;
  And his wish of the night soon gained its goal,
  For he found my _first_ when he reached my whole.

170. "Thomas," said Charles, "you are good at figures, please give
me a _figurative_ answer to this question:--What ought one to do who
arrives at a friend's house too late for dinner?"

Thomas, after thinking a little, wrote the following--1028,40. What
was his meaning?

171. A teacher, having fifteen young ladies under her care, wished
them to take a walk each day of the week. They were to walk in five
divisions of three ladies each but no two ladies were to be allowed
to walk together twice during the week. How could they be arranged to
suit the above conditions?

172.

  My first is a letter, an insect, a word,
  That means to exist; it moves like a bird.
  My next is a letter, a small part of man,
  'Tis found in all climes; search where you can.
  My third is a something seen in all brawls.
  My next you will find in elegant halls.
  My last is the first of the last part of day,
  Is ever in earnest, yet never in play.
  My whole gives a light, by some men abhorred,
  The blessings from which no pen can record.

  I'm composed of letters four,
    A turkey, cock, or hen;
  Behead me, and I upward soar.
    Put on my head again,
  Transpose me, then a beast I am,
    Both bloodthirsty and wild,
  That preys on many a helpless lamb,
    And oft devours a child.

177. I am a word of three letters, signifying to spoil or injure.
Transposed, I am an animal. Transposed again, I am a part of the human
frame.

[Illustration]

178. Why is a grist-mill like the court-martial which cashiered
Fremont?

179.

  I have wings, yet never fly--
    I have sails, yet never go--
  I can't keep still, if I try,
    Yet forever stand just so.

180. Why is a grist-mill like an orange-tree?

181. What Scripture character was a stupid sheep?

182. What animal that always has a cold chin is used to keep the
ladies' chins warm?

183. What two reasons why a young lady going to the altar is certainly

reasons for the faith that is in him?

185. What is the most cheerful part of an arsenal?

186. When does the tongue assume the functions of the teeth?

187. My first is company, my second is without company, and my third
calls company.

188.

        An emblem of stupidity,
          My first in forests found;
        Up in air oft rises high,
          Though fastened to the ground,
        But by sharp means it is removed,
          And managed various ways;
        By art or skill may be improved,
          Or, perhaps, it makes a blaze.
        My second is of every kind,
          Is good, or bad, or gay;
        Is dull or bright, to suit all minds,
          By night as well as day.
  The patient seaman keeps with care my whole,
    And well it knows his secrets night and day;
  And though it has no tongue, nor heart, nor soul,
    It tells the story of the ship's long way.

189. There is a word of six letters. Take off three letters at either
end, and add another letter, and it will make one of the most useful
members of the body.

    My first is a busy industrious thing,
    Without which no bundle your porter can bring;
    My second is nothing to speak of, yet stands
    For thousands and millions, in money or lands;
    My third is a question we meet every day,
    Relating to things we do, think, or say;
    My whole is the questioner--once it was you,
    If not, 'twas your brother, or cousin, or--whew!
  It was somebody else whom your grandmother knew.

198. I am composed of four letters. We do not 4 2 3, 1 4 2 3, 2 3, 3 4
2.

199.

  My first is a preposition.
  "  second implies more than one.
  "  third is a pronoun.
  "  fourth some people do not pay.
  "  whole is not consistent.

200.

  I am a word of four letters often used in prayer.
  Transposed, I become what every one professes.
  Transposed again, I become an adjective, the qualities of which
          every one despises.
  Transposed again, I am part of a horse.

201.

  My first is poison, slow yet sure,
    That preys on many frames;
  Compounded oft of things impure,
    And called by many names.
  My first and second form my whole,
    That's one of Satan's dens;
  Many a man has lost his soul,
    Through meeting there with friends.

202.

  I am a word of four letters--the name of a Cape.
  Transposed, I am a portion of the earth's surface.
  Transposed again, I am a kind of meat.
  Transposed again, I become a verb signifying to wash.

203.

  I prove 2 = 1, thus:--
    x = a; then x^2 = ax
    x^2 - a^2 = ax - a^2
    (x + a)(x - a) = a(x - a)
    x + a = a
    2a = a
    2 = 1
  Who will detect the fallacy?

[Illustration]

204. In what ship, and in what capacity, do young ladies like to
engage?

205.

  Ethereal thing, on unseen wing,
  Through space my first is wandering;
  It nothing sees, it nothing knows,
  Yet all that's known and seen it shows.
  Brick, iron, mud, stone, reed, or wood,
  My second in all climes has stood--
  A lodge, a nest, where love may rest,
  Or a prison, gloomy, dark, unblest.
  Away on the bleak and desolate peak
  Where the rude tempests howl and shriek,
  Like a friendly eye, looking out from the sky.
  My whole to the wanderer gleams on high.

206. What kind of a ship did Solomon object to?

207. There are two numbers whose product added to the sum of their
squares is 109, and the difference of whose squares is 24.

208.

  In every hedge my second is,
    As well as every tree,
  And when poor school-boys act amiss,
    It often is their fee.
  My first likewise is always wicked,
    Yet ne'er committed sin,
  My total for my first is fitted,
    Composed of brass or tin.

209. My first is a pronoun; my second is not high; my third we must
all do; my fourth is a pronoun of multitude; my whole is musical.

210. What is the difference between a grandmother and her infant
grandchild?

213.

  When winter months have passed away,
    And summer suns shine bright,
  You ope the coffer where I lay,
    And bring my first to light.
  My second is a valiant knight,
    Who wears his crest and spur,
  And when he's challenged to a fight,
    He does not long demur.
  My whole, as ancient fables say,
    Was once a friend of Juno,
  In dress he makes a great display--
    His name by this time you know.

214. Why is a bullet like a tender glance?

[Illustration]

215.

  When innocence first had its dwelling on earth,
    In my first's lovely form it alighted;
  And still to this time, from the hour of its birth,
    In my first it has greatly delighted.
  My second's a part of a smart lady's dress,
    Yet on age it may also be found;
  Again, 'tis a garb when the heart feels distress--
    And my whole does with pleasure abound.

216. Why are children at play like a bird in her nest?

217.

  My first is male or female, young or old,
    'Tis very sad if you are forced to doubt one;
  Much must we pity the false heart or cold,
    Who is so selfish as to live without one.
  My second is a noble work of art,
    Which brings together distant shores and lands;
  Though neither feet it has, nor head, nor heart,
    'Tis often furnished with a hundred hands.
  My whole in youth or age, sickness or health,
    In joy or sorrow, charms to life can give;
  Without it, all in vain are hoards of wealth,
    By it unblest in solitude we live.

218. What spice are the Hindoos fond of?

219. Why is a dog like a tanner?

220. Why are A B's successors seedy?

221. What is nothing good for?

222. I am composed of four letters--the initials of four of the
principal personages in Europe--the name of a river in Russia;
transposed, I am a part of the Crystal Palace; transposed again, I am
not _proud_, although elevated above the heads of most people.

223.

  My first is when the summer wind
    Sweeps rustlingly through the trees,
  When the jasmine spray and the eglantine
    Are swayed by the whispering breeze;
  My second, a weapon of bloody strife,
    Of steel, so cruel and cold,
  Which ruthlessly takes the soldier's life,
    The cowardly, and the bold;
  My whole is a Poet, by every one known,
    So wide is his renown.

224. Why is the letter y like a young spendthrift?

[Illustration]

225. Why is memory like the peacock?

226.

  My first in the garden luxuriantly grows,
  Delicious and sweet, as every one knows;
  My second a noisy, vain, garrulous thing,
  The lord of a harem, as proud as a king;
  My whole is still prouder, and seems to rejoice
  As much in his tail as he does in his voice.

227. One man said to another, "Give me one of your sheep, and I shall
have twice as many as you." The other replied, "No, give me one of
yours, and I shall have as many as you." How many had each?

228. Where were potatoes first found?

229. Where did cherries come from?

230. Why is a ship under full sail like Niagara?

231.

  O'er a mighty pasture go
    Sheep in thousands, silver white;
  As to-day we see them, so
    In the oldest grandsire's sight.
  They drink--never waning old--
    Life from an unfailing brook;
  There's a shepherd to their fold,
    With a silver-horned crook.
  From a gate of gold let out,
    Night by night he counts them over;
  Wide the field they rove about,
    Never hath he lost a rover:
  True the dog that helps to lead them,
    One gay ram in front we see;
  What the flock, and who doth lead them,
    Sheep and shepherd, tell to me?

232. I am a word of four letters. Take off my hat, and you have
something which you do every day. Take off my head, and you have
a preposition. Leave off my head and put on my hat, and you have
something used before a door. Entire, and taken backward, with my two
middle letters transposed, I am a very convenient thing. I, myself, am
often eaten.

  Ye mortals--wonder! I'm an elf,
    A strange, mysterious thing;
  More powerful than all the sprites
    Within a magic ring.
  I speak--although I have no tongue--
    I speak, and thrill the soul;
  I sing--and many a song I've sung
    Resounds, while ages roll.
  I am a weapon, strong and keen,
    All made of glittering steel;
  But human souls--not senseless flesh--
    My sharp two-edges feel.
  The greatest writer e'er was born--
    But, ah!--a thievish elf;
  For what I write is not, alas!
    Original with myself.
  I often take a cooling bath;
    But, like the Ethiop's skin,
  When I have bathed, I'm blacker still
    Than when I did begin!
  Most kind am I; I glad the heart
    Of many a wretched wight,
  And many a sufferer is by me
    Transported with delight.
  Most cruel I; I've pierced the soul
    With cutting, burning darts;
  I've dashed the fondest hopes to earth,
    I've crushed the lightest hearts.
  Yet wise and powerful as I am,
    A very slave am I;
  I'm forced the mandates to obey
    Of both the low and high.
  Now, witty brains, tell who this is,
    Who blesses and who curses;
  Who has no hands, yet still who is
    The writer of these verses.

  That gentle picture dost thou know,
    Itself, its hues, and splendor gaining?
  Some change each moment can bestow,
    Itself as perfect still remaining;
  It lies within the smallest space,
    The smallest framework forms its girth,
  And yet that picture can embrace
    The mightiest objects known on earth:
  Canst thou to me that crystal name
    (No gem can with its worth compare)
  Which gives all light, and knows no flame?
    Absorbed is all creation there!
  That ring can in itself inclose
    The loveliest hues that light the heaven,
  Yet from its light more lovely goes
    Than all which to it can be given!

  There is a mansion, vast and fair,
    That doth on unseen pillars rest;
  No wanderer leaves the portals there,

  The craft by which that mansion rose,
    No thought can picture to the soul;
  'Tis lighted by a lamp which throws
    Its stately shimmer through the whole.
  As crystal clear, it rears aloof
    The single gem which forms its roof,
  And never hath the eye surveyed
    The master who that mansion made.

262. Several things are necessary to make this sport safe and
pleasant. _First_, a strong bar on which to balance your board or
plank. _Secondly_, a strong, straight-grained board or plank, which
will not crack nor twist. _Thirdly_, an equal weight at each end, or
nearly so. _Fourthly_, a clear head, and a steady hand, or foot, to
keep up an even motion. With these all right, you will go up and
down as easily and smoothly as men of business do, or political
parties;--but, hallo there, boys, John has tumbled off, and you will
have a smash at the other end, which will leave John's partner in
doubt whether he is up or down.

  I was before the world begun,
  Before the earth, before the sun;
  Before the moon was made, to light
  With brighter beams the starry night;
  I'm at the bottom of the sea,
  And I am in immensity;
  The daily motion of the earth
  Dispels me, and to me gives birth;
  You can not see me if you try,
  Although I'm oft before your eye;
  Such is my whole. But, for one part,
  You'll find in taste I'm rather tart;
  Now I become the abode of men--
  And now, for groveling beasts, a pen;
  I am a man who lives by drinking;
  Anon I keep a weight from sinking;
  To take me, folks go far and near;
  I am what children like to hear;
  I am a shining star on high;
  And now, its pathway through the sky;
  My strength o'erpowers both iron and steel;
  Yet oft I'm left behind the wheel;
  I'm made to represent a head;
  Am found in every loaf of bread;
  Such are the many forms I take,
  You can not count all I can make;
  Yet, after all, so strange am I,
  Soon as you know me, then I die.

  Up and down two buckets ply

  Always while you quaff from this,
    That one lost in the abyss,
  From that well the waters living
    Never both together giving.

    Come from my first--ay, come! the battle dawn is nigh,
  And the screaming trump and thundering drum are calling thee to die!
  Fight as thy father fought, fall as thy father fell;
  Thy task is taught, thy shroud is wrought, so forward, and farewell!
  Toll ye, my second, toll! Fill high the flambeau's light,
  And sing the hymn of a parted soul beneath the silent night,
  The wreath upon his head, the cross upon his breast,
  Let the prayer be said, and the tear be shed--so take him to his rest.
  Call ye my whole--ay, call the lord of lute and lay,
  And let him greet the sable pall with a noble song to-day;
  Go, call him by his name! no fitter hand may crave
  To light the flame of a soldier's fame on the turf of a soldier's grave.

  Amid the serpent race is one
    That earth did never bear;
  In speed and fury there be none
    That can with it compare.
  With fearful hiss--its prey to grasp--
    It darts its dazzling course,
  And locks in one destroying clasp
    The horseman and the horse.
  It loves the loftiest heights to haunt--
    No bolt its prey secures;
  In vain its mail may valor vaunt,
    For steel its fury lures!
  As slightest straw whirled by the wind,
    It snaps the starkest tree;
  It can the might of metal grind,
    How hard soe'er it be!
  Yet ne'er but once the monster tries
    The prey it threats to gain:
  In its own wrath consumed it dies,
    And while it slays is slain.

289. Our family is large, but not much more than one third as large as
that of Jacob when he went to live in Egypt. But, like the family of
that ancient patriarch, we often migrate to other countries. We do not
keep together, whether at home or abroad; we are scattered about in
every direction,--at once masters, servants, and slaves to forty-four
millions of people. Not a book is printed without our aid; and, what
is stranger still, we are all found at the same time in every book in
every library and country where the English language is spoken; and on
almost every page. Sometimes, though rarely, two of us stand side by
side. It is still more rare for us all to appear together arranged in
the same order. Nothing is more common with people than to place us in
_rows_ or _platoons_; but whether in militia, army, or navy--for some
of us are employed in all these--we are seldom arranged twice alike.
Sometimes one of us stands first; sometimes another. Sometimes a row
or platoon consists of only two or three of us; at others of many
more; and occasionally of twelve, fifteen, or twenty; and, strangest
to relate of all, we can be so placed as to make out about 50,000
rows, no two of which will be exactly alike. Must we not, then, be a
useful family? And what, think you, is our _family_ name?

[Illustration: CHRISTMAS TREE.]

310. This is a very curious and interesting kind of a tree. It is
found, loaded with every variety of strange _fruit_, on tables, bare
floors, or carpets. It has no roots, but is most wonderful for its
yielding powers, though it bears only once a year, and that always on
Christmas Eve. The last one that I saw was at Uncle Hiram Hatchet's.
Cousin Hannah thus describes it:

"At last, when none of us expected it, he (Uncle H.) threw open the
folding doors, and let us into the little parlor. There was displayed
the Christmas tree, in all its glory. Every little twig bore some
present; dolls and doll furniture, pins, ear-rings, bracelets,
slippers, watch-guards and purses, ships, windmills, and beautiful
books, besides all sorts of fruits and bon-bons, and all blazing
with light from the numberless candles that seemed to grow out of the
branches."

  A tree that, without life or root,
    Without a blossom, bud, or flower,
  Bears various and most precious fruit,
    That comes and goes in one short hour.

  My first is an adjective, short and dry,

  Unfit for the resort of timid men,
  Whence once the righteous came safely out,
  While the wicked were wholly put to rout.

  Ere from the east arose the lamp of day,
  Or Cynthia gilt the night with paler ray--
  Ere earth was form'd, or ocean knew its place,
  Long, long anterior to the human race
  I did exist. In chaos I was found,
  When awful darkness shed its gloom around.
  In heaven I dwell, in those bright realms above,
  And in the radiant ranks of angels move.
  But when th' Almighty, by his powerful call,
  Made out of nothing this stupendous ball,
  I did appear, and still upon this earth
  Am daily seen, and every day have birth.
  With Adam I in Paradise was seen,
  When the vile serpent tempted Eve to sin;
  And, since the fall, I with the human race
  Partake their shame and manifest disgrace.
  In the dark caverns of old ocean drear
  I ever was, and ever shall appear.
  In every battle firmly I have stood,
  When plains seem lav'd, whole oceans dy'd with blood.
  But, hold--no more! It now remains with you
  To find me out and bring me forth to view.

putting people in possession of property. 3. I increase the number of
most things that come in my way. 4. I am no friend to the distressed
needlewomen, for I render needles unnecessary. 5. Yet whenever I
undertake a dress, I infallibly make it sit. 6. I am quarrelsome, for
a word and a blow is my maxim. 7. In fact, with me a word becomes a
weapon. 8. And merriment becomes slaughter. 9. It is commonly remarked
that drink converts men into swine, but I transform wine itself into
the same animals. 10. Deprived of me, certain railway speculations
come out in their true character. 11. A team can draw a wagon well
without me, still, when I am in front, the speed is wonderfully
increased. 12. Marvelous products may be obtained from peat, but
when I am extracted from earth, pure oil alone remains. 13. Let me go
before, and a story is sure to be stale. 14. And if I am left out, it
will be political. 15. I am strongly attached to pluralities. 16. With
respect to free trade, I turn corn itself into contempt. 17. I am in
the midst of Russia and Prussia, and abundant among the Swiss. 18.
Were I withdrawn from that unhappy country, Spain, nothing would be
left but grief. 19. After sport, when I take my departure, the evening
is often finished with what remains. 20. At a soiree I am always in
good time. 21. In person I am much bent, though I was formerly more
upright. 22. As to my education, I was always head of the school. 23.
Though invariably at the bottom of my class. 24. With me age looks
wise. 25. But a gentleman is better without me, as accompanied by me
he appears feminine. 26. On the contrary, a lady ought not to
part with me, for if she loses me she seems masculine. 27. I am an

Sadness commences, and, 29. Bliss terminates. 30. Yet it is in my
power to transform cares into what is delightful.

  And often is found, poor, wretched, and mean,

  What's that the poor's most precious friend,
    Nor less by kings respected--
  Contrived to pierce, contrived to rend,

  Revolving round a disk I go
    One restless journey o'er and over;
  The smallest field my wanderings know,
    Thy hand the space could cover:
  Yet many a thousand miles are passed
    In circling round that field so narrow:
  My speed outstrips the swiftest blast,
    The strongest bowman's arrow.

  A thing of beauty to the eye,
  I bear, my glittering shape beneath,
  A part of my Creator's breath;
  With ever-changing shade and hue
  I rise and vanish from the view,
  And, though a phantom deemed, I share,
  In portions, water, earth, and air.

353.

  I go, but never stir,
    I count, but never write,
  I measure and divide, and, sir,

  I tell you much, but never talk,
    In my diurnal round.

  I'm black or white, I'm brown or gray,
  I'm tall or flat, I'm grave or gay,
  As soft as wool, or stiff as tin,
  A nest for wits to nestle in.
  I hold great intellects, yet oft
  Am bothered with the weak and soft,
  And sometimes crusty, hard, and thick
  They fill me with well burned brick.
  Fashion controls me, yet I wear
  Some aspects to make fashion stare.
  Though always for one place designed,
  I change as often as the wind.
  I'm dumb, and yet, in spite of that,
  Make more than half of every "Chat,"
  I'm mild--yet none can hate--(don't doubt me)
  Nor raise a fighting-cock without me.

  In every home I stand confessed,
  A friend of quiet, peace, and rest;

  But, with ethereal lightness gay,
  I pass in idle breath away.

  'Tis said of lawyers Grab and Clinch,
  They take an ell when you offer an inch;
  But I can do a smarter thing--
  Give me an ell, I will make it ring;
  If for advice you come to me
  When you are ill, I call for the fee;
  If any road you chance to wend,
  You think you've reached the very end,
  I come and give it such a turn,
  You find there's something yet to learn;
  If to the inn you seek for rest,
  I chuck you in a box or chest;
  The beggar's rags I make so proud,
  He of his garments boasts aloud;
  The aged and infirm with me
  Lose caution and timidity;
  For, young or old, to every one
  I furnish, if not muscle, bone.

  One of a gallant vagrant band,
  My name is known in every land;
  In all earth's changes I am there;
  Without me none may war declare,
  Or treat of peace, or try their parts
  On manufacture, tillage, arts;
  By me a patient saint of old
  Was changed into a warrior bold;
  I made old Abner's father near;
  His wife was deaf, I made her hear;
  His house I put upon his back;
  His jaw an iron bond I make;
  Bad spirit by my presence claims
  To be the end of human aims;
  And a young bear is seen to be
  A coveted jewel of the sea.

The different colors represent the several sons' portions.

10. The tiger couches in the wood,
    And waits to shed the traveler's blood;--
          So couch we.
    We spring upon him to supply
    What men unto our wants deny;
          And so springs he.

11. Work, work, work!
    My labor never flags;
  And what are its wages? A bed of straw,
    A crust of bread--and rags,
  That shattered roof--this naked floor,
    A table--a broken chair,
  And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank
    For sometimes falling there!
  With fingers weary and worn,
    With eyelids heavy and red,
  A woman sat in unwomanly rags,
    Plying her needle and thread.
    Stitch! stitch! stitch!
  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
    And still with a voice of dolorous pitch.
  She sang the "Song of the Shirt."

  There's a grim hearse horse,
  In a jolly round trot,
  To the churchyard a poor man is going, I wot.
  The road it is rough,
  And the hearse has no springs,
  And hark to the dirge the sad driver sings--
  "Rattle his bones over the stones,
  He's only a pauper, whom nobody owns."

26.

  Of all the birds that e'er I did see,
  The owl is the strangest in every degree,
  For all the long day she sits in a tree,
  And when the night comes, away flies she,
        To whit-to-whoo.
  To whom drinkest thou? Sir Noodles, to you.
  This song is well sung, I make you a vow,
  And he is a knave that aileth now.
  Nose, nose, and who gave thee that jolly red nose?
  Cinnamon and ginger, nutmeg and cloves,
  And they gave me my jolly red nose.

  Full five hundred years I've hung,
    In my old grey turret high,
  And many a different theme I've sung,
    As the hours went winging by.
  I've pealed the chimes of a wedding morn;
    Ere night I've sadly tolled to say
  That the maid was coming love lorn,
    And here I end my lay.

37.

  The joyful can sing on spirit wings
    Each morn his lofty height,
  In rapt'rous notes he sweetly sings,
    And hails th' approaching light;
  But I from grief no solace know,
    No portal from the night,
  All joys to me insipid grow,
    Afford me no delight.

38. Because it is often tolled (told).

39. Your name.

40. The letter M.

41. Forty-eight feet.

42. In solving this question it is clear that to pick up the first
stone and put it into the basket, the person must walk two yards, one
in going for the stone and another in returning with it; that for the
second stone he must walk four yards, and so on increasing by two as
far as the hundredth, when he must walk two hundred yards, so that
the sum total will be the product of 202 multiplied by 50, or 10,100
yards. If any one does not see why we multiply 202 by 50 in getting
the answer, we refer him to his arithmetic.

47. To keep his head warm.

  Hark! the muffled drum sounds the last march of the brave,
  The soldier retreats to his quarters, the grave,
  Under Death, whom he owns his Commander-in-chief,
  No more he'll turn out with the ready relief;
  But in spite of Death's terrors or cannon's alarms,
  When he hears the last trump he'll stand to his arms!
  Farewell! brother soldiers, in peace may you rest,
  And light lie the turf on each veteran breast,
  Until that review when the souls of the brave
  Shall behold the chief ensign, fair mercy's flag, wave;
  Then, freed from Death's terrors and hostile alarms,
  When we hear the last trump, we'll stand to our arms.

49. Doctor Long expects Dr. Short to explain the misunderstanding
between them.

50.

  To you who live _single_, if this at all trouble you,
  My first comes in kindness, commanding to _double you_.
  And again, it will _double you_, if, like a clown,
  You lift high your _sole_, and bend your head down;
  Or, cut it in twain, two _V's_ will appear,
  And _V_ counting five, both make _ten_ it is clear.
  My second, alas! comes shrouded in gloom,
  It is _O_, which makes _wo_, _the sinner's sad doom_.
  Now see what a change comes over the scene,
  If my third, which is _O_, be added again.
  Now 'tis _woo_--and what bachelor's heart does not beat,
  To _woo_ a sweet damsel, to keep warm his feet;
  To cheer by her smiles his lone hours--and thus
  Escape, by good fortune, the bachelor's curse!
  My fourth and my last, as I'll go on to tell,
  Is nought more or less than a _capital L_.
  Now _L_ being _fifty_, will even divide
  _One Hundred_, or teachers and books have all lied.
  Now examine with care, and plain you will see
  That to unlock a secret, an _L_ is the key;
  For _woo_, with _L_ added, is changed into _wool_,
  Whether worn on a _sheep_, or an African's skull.
  Whether made into clothing, for bed or for body,
  For "_sage politician_" or some other _noddy_.
  It is used, the world over, in commerce and trade;
  But its _last use_, I trow, was to make a _charade_.

51. SONG OF THE SUN.

    Not a rose that blooms,
    Not a ring that assumes
      The rainbow's beautiful front,
    But's indebted to me,
    As ye plainly see,
      For the scent or splendor on't.
    The moon and the stars
    That around ye roll,
      The systems ye can not discern,
    Are warmed by my rays,
    And partake of the soul
      And the spirit that in me burn.
  And nothing throws back with such splendor my rays,
  As the sea's mighty mirror in midsummer days.

52. And like the temple of this body, the cloud-capped towers, the
gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself shall
fall, and, like this insubstantial vision faded, leave not a rack
behind.

53. Letter I.

57. He is a bit of a buck.

  'Twas at night, when the bell had tolled twelve,
    And poor Susan was laid on her pillow,
  In her ear whispered some fleeting elf--
    "Your love is now tossed on the billow"
          Far, far at sea.
  All was dark as she woke out of breath--
    Not an object her fears could discover;
  All was still as the portals of death,
    Save fancy, which painted her lover
          Far, far at sea.
  So she whispered a prayer, closed her eyes,
    But the phantom still haunted her pillow,
  While in terror she echoed his cries,
    As struggling he sunk on the billow
          Far, far at sea.

71.

  Lightly tread--'tis holy ground:
  Countless dead hark, hark around;

  Music meet for lovers' woes.

  At the peaceful midnight hour,
  Every sense and every power
  Chained lies in downy sleep;
  Then our careful watch we keep,
  While the wolf, in nightly prowl,
  Bays the moon with hideous howl;
  Closed are bars, a vain resistance;
  Shrieks are raised, but no assistance;
  Silence! or you'll meet your fate;
  Your keys, jewels, money, plate.
  Locks, bolts, and bars soon fly asunder,
  Then to rifle, rob, and plunder.

77. Ad-here.--In-here.--Co-here.

78. Because only the _bony part_ is left.

80. XII., that is, a cross two i's (across two eyes).

81. Because he kneads (needs) it most.

82. The letter R.

83.

  The coward skulking round a house,
    Is like a mouse-trap as you see,
  For that will _puzzle any mouse_,
    And _pusillanimous_ is he.

84. Green grass is like a mouse, because the cattle eat it
      (cat'll eat it).

  Glorious Apollo from on high beheld us
  Wand'ring to find a temple for his praise;
  Sent Polyhymnia hither to shield us
  While we ourselves such a temple might raise.
  Thus then, Guards, hands and hearts joining,
  Sing we in harmony Apollo's praise.
  Here every generous sentiment awaking,
  Music inspiring our mutual joy,
  Each social bumper giving and partaking,
  Song and good cheer our time employ.

  While each star through the dark gloom of night,
  Lends a clear and cheering light,
    Who a doubt or fear can feel?
  Now through woods like serpents creeping,
  Then on our prey like lions leaping,
    Calvert to the onset leads us.
    Let the weary traveler dread us.
  Struck with terror and amaze;
  While our swords in lightning pouring,
  Thunder to our rifles roaring.

96. A bell.

97.

  cbd/(dc + c) hours to go down.

  When the rosy dawn awaking
    Paints with gold the verdant lawn;
  Flies, on the wings of time disporting,
    Sip the sweets and taste the dawn.
  Warbling birds the day proclaiming,
    Singing sweet the lively strain;

    And mark the graves on either side;
  Or where the rough old sexton talks
    With sheer contempt of human pride;
  To contemplate the scattered bones
    That meet the eye so often there;
  To read the inscription on the stones,
    And think what fleeting things we are.
  'Tis good at twilight's sober hour,
    To sit on some neglected tomb,
  And dwell on death's all-startling power,
    And muse upon our certain doom.
  Because these thoughts are sure to win
    The spirit more or less from sin.

PREFACE.


In presenting to the public this NEW BOOK OF PUZZLES, I must present
my thanks for the many kind expressions received in regard to those
already published. It has been compiled during my leisure moments of
the past season, for the benefit of the numerous readers of MERRY'S
MUSEUM, and contains, in a compact form, many of the Puzzles, Enigmas,
Hieroglyphics, etc., which have appeared in the MUSEUM, together with
many new ones; and is presented with the hope that it may be the means
of interesting the young folks around their own fireside homes, rather
than seek amusement elsewhere.

HOW TO MAKE ANAGRAMS.

"Now that's _too_ bad!" exclaimed little Bess, striking her pencil
down quickly on the slate, which had for five minutes been shaded by
her brown curls, as she bent earnestly over it. "I do say it's _too_
bad."

"_What_ is too bad, Bess?" asked her oldest sister, Mary, who,
apparently occupied with her history, had been stealing occasional
glances at the animated face over the slate, and watching with
pleasing interest the busy fingers putting down letters, and tripping
back and forth among them with her pencil-point. "_What_ is too bad,
Bess? I thought something was pleasing you very much."

"Oh! did you? Well, I _was_ just ready to have such a good one--these
anagrams, you know. I surely thought I had extra axes, and just
because of an _r_, it's all spoiled!"

"What were you going to make your extra axes out of?" asked Mary, with
a curious smile.

"Now, _don't_ make fun of me, please. Artaxerxes was my word."

"Well, I should _think_ that would just make it," said Mary,
thoughtfully. "Are you _sure_ it will not?"

"Don't you see that _r_?" asked Bess, holding up her slate and giving
a bayonet thrust to the offending letter.

"Yes; but what has that _r_, all alone by itself, to do with it?"

"Why, it's my _proof_. You see I write down my word, and rub out each
letter of it as I use it in picking out my new words, so if none are
left, my anagram is complete."

"So you found an extra _r_, instead of an extra axe, in your way?
Well, that _is_ rather trying; but then there are plenty of more
words, and it isn't much work to get them out. You have a capital way.
Besides, that wouldn't have been so very good a one. You know 'Aunt
Sue' says the word and the sentence should bear some relation to each
other. Now, if Artaxerxes had been a famous wood-cutter instead of a
Persian king, it might have been too bad."

"But wasn't he a warrior, too and mightn't they be battle-axes?"

Mary admitted the force of this, with a smile, as she went on to say:

"When we see such anagrams as 'astronomers--no more stars,' and
'parishioners--I hire parsons,' there is a certain sense of fitness
that produces all the pleasure I can find in an anagram."

"I know they're better; but, then, not half of them _do_ mean
anything. _I_ never could make such ones."

"I should try, if I made them out at all, to have them just right. You
must remember it takes some _patience_ to _get_ them, as well as to
_make_ them. You want the satisfaction of feeling paid when you're
through."

"Patience! I should think it did!" said Bess, laughing and repeating,
"Oh, Sam, cut my pen!" in a very comical manner. "If _that_ didn't
take the patience of Job! And what did it _mean_, after all? I'm sure
Webster don't know! I think they ought to be _fair_, at least!"

"So do I," said Mary, laughing at Bessie's earnestness. "Now try the
word _homestead_, Bess, and see what you can make of that."

"Why, _is_ it one?"

"I'm not quite sure; I was running it over in my _mind_ to-day; but I
had no slate to prove my canceling correct."

"What did you _think_ it made?"

"Do-eat-hams."

"Oh, so it will," said Bess, hastily putting down the letters; "and
you know they do eat hams at homesteads!" Then Bess began drawing the
tip of her forefinger slowly through each letter, repeating slowly,
"do e-a-t-h- --_There, now_, that's worse than Artaxerxes! If that _e_
was only an _a_!"

Mary looked on the slate a moment, and then said, pleasantly, "But you
see it isn't!"

"How easy you do take things, Mary! Now, that would be _so_ good, and
it comes so near!"

"That's the _best way to take things_, isn't it, Bess?" said Mary,
gently lifting Bessie's face by the little fat chin, and looking
into her large blue eyes lovingly. "Anagrams, you see, may teach us a
lesson."

"_Almost_ anagrams, you should say," said Bess. "Well, let's try
something else. Shall we try 'Aunt Sue?'"

"Yes, put it down."

"I can get--let me see--yes, 'use-a-nut;' but that don't _mean_
anything like 'Aunt Sue.'"

"Oh, yes, that will do as well as your 'battle-axes.' You know, she
keeps 'nuts' for the 20,000 to crack in her '_drawer_.'"

"Oh, that's it!--let me send it."

"Very well; and if I get time, we will try and have two or three more
ready by the next number, and every one with a meaning."

When Bess gave Mary her good-night kiss, she said to herself, "I like
to get out puzzles; but I'd rather have Mary's patience than all the
anagrams in the world. I wonder if I should try _very hard_, if I ever
could be like her!"

  Though for years I had lived, I was unknown to fame,
  Till I rescued a slave, and I gave him my name.
  Though then Abolitionist--still I enthrall,
  And unless I imprison--of no use at all.
  'Tis strange I should be both a boon and a blow,
  But when you discern me, this fact you will know.
  Doctors' stuff I convey and small matters unfold,
  Yet rare gems I preserve and great nuggets of gold.
  In form I am round or three-cornered or square,
  And at once I am known as both common and rare.
  If you wish to be safe when you look at a show,
  You must pay for, and take me, and sit in a row.
  Clothed in crimson, and purple, and black I am seen,
  Yet in gardens in winter I'm constantly green.
  I am valued and dear, though 'tis equally clear,
  I am scorned and am hated when placed on the _ear_.
  Both of light goods and heavy I carry the trade,
  Yet in gold I'm oft clothed and in jewels arrayed.
  If bad passion disturb, or should ill-will excite,
  I become the forerunner of many a fight.
  Yet stranger than all these remarkable things,
  I'm a gift oft bestowed by princes and kings.

    N.B.--As I find it impossible to display all my qualities and
    peculiarities in verse, I will endeavor to describe myself
    more minutely in plain prose. I am either animal, vegetable,
    or mineral, and though sometimes no bigger than a bright
    copper penny or a silver sixpence, yet I am at times as large
    as a room--indeed, I _am_ a room, and can contain several
    people; and then, too, I am made narrow, and can only contain
    one horse! In summer and winter I flourish as a vegetable, and
    am often cut, but never served at table. I am most valued at
    the end of the year, when I am often given and often taken.
    Though unlearned, I have given name to a science--a very
    _striking_ quality you will acknowledge, when you know me. If
    you discover me, you deserve me as a _reward_. If you are dull
    of comprehension, you deserve me as a _punishment_! May you
    have your deserts!

  I knew a man, not many years gone by,
  Who had a _block of timber_ in each eye,
  Without impairing, in the least, his sight,
  Or filling those who saw him with affright.
  And what was more amazing, free to roam,
  _Fur-covered thousands_ made his head their home;
  _Two heavy buildings_ also rested there,
  By them unnoticed, and no less his care.
  _A curse upon his meals_ he often had,
  And saw with joy it made another glad.
  Strangest of all, for every house he let,
  A _half a score of insects_ did beset.
  At length he did become _a seasoned dish_,
  To grace a throne, which suited well his wish;
  And all this while _an arrow, mind_, was in him,
  Which to the things he loved did firmly pin him.

THE NEST BUILDERS.


  Oh! beautiful, beautiful things!
    How they range at will through the sky!
  Dear Mary, if I could have wings,
    Oh! wouldn't I, wouldn't I fly?

  I would float far away on the cloud,
    All vailed in the silver mist;
  And perhaps I should feel so proud,
    I shouldn't come back to be kissed.

  But see, sis, the sweet little creatures
    Have each a straw in his beak;
  A lesson of duty to teach us,
    As plainly as birds can speak.

  We think they are only playing,
    As they roam to and fro in the sky;
  But these busy fellows are saying,
    "'Tis not all for pleasure we fly.

  "We're building a snug little nest
    In the crotch of the old elm-tree
  We mean it for one of the best,
    And busy enough are we.

  "We would not live only for play;
    And when for a song we take leisure,
  We would show, in our caroling way,
    How duty is wedded to pleasure."




[Illustration]


KINDNESS.


  A rose was faint, and hung its head,
    One sultry summer's day,
  When a Zephyr kindly fann'd its cheek,
    Then sped upon its way.

  That Zephyr now, where'er it roams,
    Delicious perfume brings.
  So kindness gathers, as it goes,
    A fragrance for its wings.

  AUNT SUE.

SNOW-FLAKES.


  Are the snow-flakes pearly flowers
    That in the skies have birth,
  And gently fall in gleaming showers
    Upon this barren earth?

  Or, are they fleecy locks of wool,
    From sheep that wander by
  The silver streams, that, singing, roll
    Through valleys in the sky?

  Or, are they downy feathers, cast
    By little birds above,
  And hurried earthward by the blast,
    Bright messengers of love?

  No, they are pearly blossoms, flung
    From heaven's airy bowers,
  To recompense us for the loss
    Of summer's blooming flowers.

SPRING FLOWERS.


  With what a lavish hand
    God beautifies the earth,
  When everywhere, all o'er the land,
    Sweet flowers are peeping forth!

  Down by the babbling brook,
    Up in the silent hills,
  The glen, the bower, the shady nook,
    Their breath with fragrance fills.

  They creep along the hedge,
    They climb the rugged height,
  And, leaning o'er the water's edge,
    Blush in their own sweet light.

  They seem to breathe and talk;
    They pour into my ear;
  Where'er I look, where'er I walk,
    A music soft and clear.

  They have no pride of birth,
    No choice of regal bower;
  The humblest, lowliest spot on earth
    May claim the fairest flower.

TOP PHILOSOPHY.


  Children must be busy,
    Always something learning;
  Toys and trinkets, for their secrets,
    Inside-outward turning.

  While the top is spinning,
    Boys are wondering all,
  How it stands erect unaided,
    Why it does not fall.

  While the top is humming,
    Still the wonder grows,
  By what art the little spinner
    Whistles as it goes.

  Children learn while playing;
    Children play while learning;
  Pastimes, often more than lessons,
    Into knowledge turning.

BY THE LAKE.


  Moonlight gleams upon the lake;
  Noiselessly the waters break
  On the white and pebbly shore,
  Then return, to break once more.

  Yonder moon, the sky's bright green,
  Glitters in its depths serene,
  And the stars, above that glow,
  Seem another heaven below.

  On the white lake shore I stand,
  Where the waters meet the land,
  Shadows all around me lie,
  Shutting out the starry sky--

  Shutting out the world around,
  In their close and narrow bound,
  And the past awhile doth seem,
  But a half-forgotten dream.

  In the starry night, alone,
  Earthly cares and thoughts are gone.
  In this silence, deep and still,
  Who could harbor thought of ill?

  Far from all the care and strife,
  All the agony of life,
  Who would deem the sun could rise
  On earth's thousand miseries?

  One by one my thoughts come back
  To the old, familiar track,
  And I turn me from the shore,
  To the busy world once more.

  ADELBERT OLDER.

GENTLE WORDS.


  Kind words revive the weary soul,
    And cheer its saddest hours,
  As dew refreshes drooping leaves,
    And brightens fading flowers.

  They fall, like sunshine, round the path
    Of those who weary roam,
  And are the "open sesame"
    To every heart and home.

  We know the spring will soon appear,
    When round us flies the swallow,
  So kind words should be harbingers
    Of gentle deeds which follow.

  Upon the brow of want and care
    The joys of life they fling,
  And change the soul's dark night to-day,
    Its winter into spring.

  Then let your deeds be gentle deeds,
    Your words be words of love;
  They are the brightest gems which shine
    In angels' crowns above.

  MATTIE BELL.

THE FROST.


  The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,
  And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;
  So through the valley and over the height
      In silence I'll take my way.
  I will not go on like that blustering train--
  The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
  Who make so much bustle and noise in vain;
      But I'll be as busy as they."

  Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;
  He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dress'd
  In diamond beads; and over the breast
      Of the quivering lake he spread
  A coat of mail, that it need not fear
  The downward point of many a spear,
  That he hung on its margin, far and near,
      Where a rock could rear its head.

  He went to the windows of those who slept,
  And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;
  Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepp'd,
      By the light of the morn were seen
  Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;
  There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;
  There were cities with temples and towers; and these
      All pictured in silver sheen!

  But he did one thing that was hardly fair--
  He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
  That all had forgotten for him to prepare--
      "Now, just to set them a-thinking,
  I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,
  "This costly pitcher I'll burst in three;
  And the glass of water they've left for me
      Shall 'tchick!' to tell them I'm drinking!"

SKATING--WOMAN'S RIGHTS.


  Why may not a woman skate?
    She can walk, and run, and ride--
  In dance, or hop, she's always great--
    Prithee why not skate or slide?
  Skating is a useful art,
    Full of dignity and grace;
  Exercises limb and heart,
    Gives the blood a healthful pace.

  Why may not a woman skate?
    Swan-like grace and queenly sway
  Mark the vigorous, blooming Kate,
    Sailing down yon glittering way.
  Look! what conscious grace and power
    In those broad, out-sweeping strides,
  As down the silver-gleaming floor,
    With still increasing speed she glides.

  Why may not a woman skate?
    Often on the frozen Scheldt,
  Buxom Dutch girls, early, late,
    For the prize of speed have dealt.
  Sometimes from the inland town
    To the city mart, or fair,
  They in merry bands glide down,
    And their precious burdens bear.

  Why may not a woman skate?
    To a friend's, long miles away,
  Oft they sail, with heart elate,
    To make a call, or pass the day.
  Often so do lovers meet,
    Whispering, wooing, billing, cooing,
  While upon their iron feet,
    Miles and miles of talk they're doing.

  Why may not a woman skate?
    What though ankles she reveal!
  Skater's ankles, critics state,
    Are not over-much genteel.
  What of that!--a trifling charge!
    There's a right for every wrong--
  If the ankle's somewhat large,
    May be 'tis well set and strong.

  Why may not a woman skate?
    Six times we have put the question;
  No one rising in debate,
    No one offering a suggestion,
  Silence gives consent. So, then,
    Pretty girls, and women, too,
  No less than rude boys and men,
    May put on the iron shoe.

  Try it, girls--ay, try the skate--
    Good for service, seldom tired,
  Able to sustain its weight,
    Never weak, nor loosely wired--
  The well-tried ankle you will find
    In your need-hour just the one;
  Bind your skates on--never mind!--
    You will find it right good fun.

SCHOOL SONNET.


    Spell, spell, spell!
  A dozen words or more;
  To your task and learn it well--
    School days will soon be o'er.

    Write, write, write!
  A page all bright and clean;
  Seize the moments in their flight,
    No lost one fall between.

    Learn, learn, learn!
  Some useful thing each day.
  From early morn till night returns,
    Waste not your time in play.

THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS.


  It is said that the flowers, as well as the birds,
  Have a language peculiar, with phrases and words;
  And that oft, in the hush of a warm summer day,
  You may hear, if you listen, whatever they say.

  I have doubted till lately, and thought it was all
  The whim of some dreamer, whom poet they call;
  But since the sweet seventh of June, fifty-one,
  My doubts have all vanished, like mists in the sun.

  As I walked in the garden I saw a sweet rose,
  Such as seldom on this side of Paradise grows,
  With a deep, deepening blush overspreading its cheek,
  Leaning down to a lily, as if it would speak.

  Behind a tall orange in bloom, as it spread
  Its rich fragrant shadow all over the bed,
  Unperceived by the parties, I paused in my walk
  And, in truth, overheard an intelligent talk.

  First, a low, distant murmur arrested my ear,
  Like the memory of tones which in dreaming we hear;
  Then, clear and distinct, though subtile as thought,
  Their simple, articulate language I caught.

  "Thou fairest of gems," said the rose, bending down,
  "Too sweet for the earth and too chaste for a crown,
  I would thou wert taller, that here, in my place,
  The world might appreciate thy sweetness and grace."

  "Nay, nay, lovely rose," the fair lily replied,
  "It is safer in humble retirement to hide;
  Earth's praises I court not; my graces were given
  To exhale, in their careless redundance, to heaven."

  As the rest of their talk was of love, and as I
  Was acting the part of an eaves-dropping spy,
  I will not report it; but this I have told,
  As conveying a lesson for young and for old.

THE SONG OF THE EXILE.


  Blow, blow, ye winds, from the wide blue sea!
    Oh, cool the heat of this fevered brow,
  And still this heart with such melody
    As your fluttering wings are wafting now!

  Bear on, bear on, from that distant shore,
    The loving tones of a household band
  Whose cherished, forms I see no more,
    Ye voices dim from my fatherland!

  Such sad, sweet thoughts to me ye bring
    Of my own far home with its ivied walls,
  Of the vine-wreathed porch, where the zephyr sings
    Through the rustling leaves, and the sunbeam falls--

  Of the threshold stone, and the open door,
    Of the kindred forms that gathered there,
  At the stilly eve full hearts to pour,
    In a gush of song on the listening air--

  Of the noisy flow of the little brook,
    Whose mossy banks our footsteps haunted;
  Of winds which half their sweetness took
    From fragrant bowers our hands had planted.

THE HARVEST.


  Trusting in the patient earth
    For the coming need,
  Went the hopeful sower forth,
    Bearing precious seed.

  Precious seed and full of hope,
    Scattered far and wide,
  O'er the plain--along the slope--
    And by the river side.

  Softened by the vernal rain,
    Quickened by the sun,
  Every little planted grain
    Peep'd forth, one by one.

  Nourished by the rain and dew,
    And the genial light,
  Blade by blade it upward grew,
    Growing day and night.

  Waving in the summer gales,
    Bowing to the blast,
  O'er the teeming intervales,
    Ripening to the last.

  Duly to the harvest white,
    Goldenly it glows,
  As with grateful heart, and light,
    Forth the reaper goes.

  Brightly as the sickle swings,
    Flashing in the sun,
  Merrily the reaper sings,
    While the moments run.

  Onward as the strong man goes,
    Fall the golden heads,
  Till the grain, in beauteous rows,
    All the field o'erspreads.

  Gather, gather now with care,
    Binding up your sheaves,
  Save what holy thrift and prayer
    For the gleaner leaves.

  Now, upon the groaning wain,
    Pile your treasures high,
  Thankful for the gentle rain,
    And the genial sky.

  Grateful for the bounteous earth,
    Trusting all to come,
  Now with songs of cheerful mirth,
    Bring the harvest home.

  Dance and sing in joyous ring,
    Ere the day grows dim;
  Rejoice, rejoice, with heart and voice,
    Shout, shout the Harvest Hymn.

THE SNOW-HOUSE.

"A palace, or a cot--it matters not."]


THE SNOW-HOUSE.


  See, Charlie, out there, by the elm tree,
    The snow has been eddying round,
  And has made, for our winter snow-house,
    A broad and beautiful mound.

  Come, Charlie, bring out your shovel,
    And soon we will let them see
  How nice, how snug, and how cosy,
    Our winter palace can be.

  The door shall be arched and lofty,
    The room within shall be round;
  And we'll have a fireplace and chimney,
    And a carpet of straw for the ground.

  Then we'll have a magnificent party,
    And all our friends receive,
  With chestnuts, popped corn, and candy,
    On Christmas or New Year's eve.

  The Merrys all shall be invited,
    Around our board to sit;
  They with our house will be delighted,
    And we'll enjoy their wit.

COLD WATER.


  Cold water, pure, sparkling, and bright,
    Cold water forever for me;
  Cold water _you_, too, must drink to-night,
    Who have come to our apple spree.

  For nothing else you will get to drink,
    Of that most sure you may be;
  No _wine_, no _brandy_ will we allow
    At our red-apple spree.

  No _cider_, no _rum_, no _lager bier_,
    Or any such stuff will you see;
  But pure cold water, fresh from the pump,
    We will have at our apple spree.

  Drink as much as you will, good friends and true,
    For nothing it costs, you see,
  And in these hard times it is best to have
    An economical spree.

  So a spree we will have, and a jolly one too,
    And none the worse shall we be
  To-morrow, for having joined to-night
    In a real red-apple spree.

THE GOOD OLD PLOW.


  Let them laud the notes that in music float
    Through the bright and glittering hall,
  While the amorous whirl of the hair's bright curl
    Round the shoulders of beauty fall;
  But dearest to me is the song of the tree,
    And the rich and the blossoming bough--
  Oh! these are the sweets which the rustic greets,
    As he follows the good old plow.

  All honor be, then, to those gray old men,
    When at last they are bowed with toil;
  Their warfare then o'er, they battle no more,
    For they've conquered the stubborn soil;
  And the chaplet he wears is his silver hairs,
    And ne'er shall the victor's brow
  With a laurel crown in his grave go down,
    Like the sons of the good old plow.

WINTER.


  Who does not love the Winter,
    When all on earth below,
  The houses, streams, the trees, and rocks,
    Are covered o'er with snow--
  When all is fair which once was bare,
    And all is bright and gay,
  When down the hillside rush the sleds,
    Nor stop till far away?

  And then the noise of all the boys,
    When snow-balls fly around--
  The snow-king in the meadow-field,
    With icy jewels crowned--
  And sparkling as the purest gold,
    The scepter in his hand,
  While icy courtiers, grim and still,
    Await his high command.

  And then when evening closes in
    Around the household hearth,
  We love to sit while jokes pass round,
    And all is joy and mirth.
  And then recount with ready tongues
    The mishaps of the day,
  Of plunges in the deep snow-drifts
    When at our joyous play.

  And though the Spring may boast its flowers,
    And all its green-clad trees;
  Though Summer, with its healthy showers,
    Brings many a cooling breeze;
  And though in Autumn with the crops
    Of grain and fruit we're blest,
  Yet still I can not help but say,
    I love the Winter best.

JUNE.


  'Tis a truth that earnest students,
    With books and nature who commune,
  Are in thought and feeling quickened
    By the skies and breath of June.

  While in boyhood, what could match it?
    Schoolmates call so opportune;
  "Come with me and range the forest--
    Recreate, this day of June."

  Sister-schoolmates, gathering posies,
    Stop to hear the red-breast's tune,
  And laugh at pretty squirrels running
    Up the trees, in leafy June.

  After-life, for prizes striving,
    The student toils for lengthened rune--
  Spirit (so success) is wafted
    To him by the breath of June.

  Month of months--let's sing its praises!
    MUSEUM-readers, join the tune--
  The freshest leaves, the brightest flowers,
    All are thine, sweet month of June.

WORK AND PLAY.


  With mamma for a teacher,
    'Tis easy to learn;
  Her eye gives her boy courage,
    As hard pages turn.

  She says, "Now, my dear Freddy,
    Learn every word right;
  If you're patient, the hard spots
    Will vanish from sight.

  "When this task is well finished,
    Your _work_ will be done;
  _Then_ the time comes for playing,
    Says every one.

  "Your fleet rock-horse is waiting;
    And baby shall see."
  Freddy learned well his lessons,
    And rides full of glee.

  Don't tell me of to-morrow,
    There is much to do to-day,
  That can never be accomplished,
    If we throw the hours away.
  Every moment has its duty--
    Who the future can foretell?
  Then why put off till to-morrow,
    What to-day can do as well?




THE BUTTERFLY.


  "Don't kill me,"--caterpillar said,
    As Clara raised her heel,
  Upon the humble worm to tread,
    As though it could not feel.

[Illustration]

  "Don't kill me--I will crawl away,
    And hide me from your sight,
  And when I come, some other day,
    You'll view me with delight."

  The caterpillar went and hid
    In some dark, quiet place,
  Where none could look on what he did,
    To change his form and face.

  And then, one day, as Clara read
    Within a shady nook,
  A butterfly, superbly dressed,
    Alighted on her book.

[Illustration]

  His shining wings were dotted o'er
    With gold, and blue, and green,
  And Clara owned she naught before
    So beautiful had seen.

COLD WATER.


  You may boast of your brandy and wine as you please,
    Gin, cider, and all the rest;
  Cold water transcends them in all the degrees,
    It is _good_--it is BETTER--'tis BEST.
  It is good to warm you when you are cold,
    Good to cool you when you are hot;
  It is good for the young--it is good for the old,
    Whatever their outward lot.
  It is better than brandy to quicken the blood,
    It is better than gin for the colic;
  It is better than wine for the generous mood,
    Than whisky or rum for a frolic.
  'Tis the best of all drinks for quenching your thirst,
    'Twill revive you for work or for play;
  In sickness or health, 'tis the best and the first--
    Oh! try it--you'll find it will pay.

THE TELEGRAPH--ITS SECRET.


  Looking up in musing wonder
  At the silent wires above him,
  And profoundly meditating,
  Suddenly says Mike--that's Michael--
  Suddenly says Pat--that's Patrick--
  "Can you show me, can you tell me,
  How it is that news and letters,
  How it is that big newspapers,
  Full of news, and fun, and wisdom,
  Travel ever back and forward,
  Travel with the speed of lightning--
  Always going, always coming,
  And yet never interfering;
  While we, sitting under, watching,
  Can not see them, can not hear them,
  Can not draw their secret from them;
  Can not tell how 'tis they do it,
  Can not quite believe they do it,
  Though we all the while do know it?"

    "Should you ask me, Mike"--that's Michael--
  "Should you ask," says Pat--that's Patrick--
  "How these silent wires above us
  Talk, and write, and carry letters--
  Carry news, and carry orders,
  Though we can not see nor hear them,
  Sitting under, watching, listening--
  Can not see them, can not hear them,
  Can not catch the smallest whisper
  Of the messages they carry--
  I should answer, I should tell you,
  That those little wires are hollow,
  With a passage running through them
  From the one end to the other;
  And they send, not papers through them,
  And they send, not written letters;
  But they send--these strange magicians--
  Through those passages so narrow,
  Whispering spirits, living fairies,
  Flying ever back and forward,
  Message-bearing, hither, thither--
  Faithful messengers, that tell not
  You, nor me, though watching, listening,
  What the messages they carry."

    "Och! indade," says Mike--that's Michael--
  "Do you know it, Pat"--that's Patrick--
  "Do you know it, Pat, for certain?
  Have you seen the whispering spirits?
  Have you seen these living fairies?
  Have you heard them shooting by us?
  Have you heard their fairy whisper?
  Tell me, do you know it, surely?
  Tell me, is it only blarney?"

    Then in anger, Pat--that's Patrick--
  Proudly answered, "Mike"--that's Michael--
  "Sure you know I'm Pat"--that's Patrick--
  "Sure you know I was in College;
  Four long years in F----m College--
  Hewing wood and bearing water,
  Kindling fires, and chores achieving,
  For the great and learned scholars
  Of the mighty F----m College.
  So you needn't, Mike"--that's Michael--
  "Set me down for a Know-Nothing;
  Needn't reckon me a Hindoo;
  Needn't doubt that what I tell you
  Is as true as if a lawyer
  Should have told it to a jury;
  Or as if a man in Congress
  Or in caucus said and swore it
  On his everlasting honor,
  On his faith and on his conscience;
  This, I trust, will satisfy you."

THE UMBRELLA, AND THE APRIL SHOWER.


  Keep close--we'll crowd the closer,
    The harder it shall pour;
  'Tis seldom one umbrella
    Is called to shelter four;
  But ours is large and generous,
    And has a heart for more.

  Yet faster, and yet faster,
    The pelting sheets arrive,
  And our one good umbrella
    Is bound to shelter five,
  For we are packed as snugly
    As bees within a hive.

  Now let it come in torrents--
    We're snug as snug can be;
  What cares our brave umbrella
    For five, or four, or three?
  On every side 'tis shedding
    The rain in careless glee.

  The clouds are very leaky,
    The bottom must be out,
  But, with our good umbrella,
    We have no fear nor doubt,
  Though every stick above us
    Rains like a tiny spout.

  Heigho! 'tis coming faster,
    The bottles sure have burst;
  But hark! the brave umbrella
    Says, "Clouds, do _now_ your worst,
  If you would wet these children,
    You must destroy me first."

  They must have thrown wide open
    The windows of the sky;
  But, with our good umbrella,
    I think we'll get home dry;
  Or, if we do get sprinkled,
    We'll neither fret nor cry.

  Step lightly, bonnie sister,
    Keep close, sweet little pet,
  With such a brave umbrella,
    We shall not be much wet;
  But Prink will have a drenching,
    On that I'll make a bet.

  How like a river torrent
    It pours along the street!
  Prink cares not for umbrellas,
    To him a bath's a treat,
  And our good India-rubbers
    Are umbrellas for our feet.

  What's that you say, dear Nellie?
    'Tis dropping on your arm?
  Indeed, our kind umbrella
    Didn't mean you any harm;
  And soon the good snug parlor
    Will make all dry and warm.

  Ha! ha! the wind is rising,
    But we are almost there.
  What if our good umbrella
    Should fly away in air!
  Run, Prink, and say we're coming,
    And open the gate--do you hear!

THE OSTRICH.


  Let the fur-clad Laplander boast
    Of the reindeer's bird-like speed;
  Let the Arab, for riding post,
    Bet high on his mettlesome steed;

  Let the Briton talk loud of the chase
    With the fox, or the hare, or the stag;
  Let the Yankee, stark mad in the race,
    Count miles by the minutes, and brag;

  The bird of the desert is ours--
    Competitors all we defy--
  A bird of such wonderful powers--
    We scarce know if we ride or we fly.

  You have all of the hippogriff heard,
    For mettle and speed a rare thing,
  Half-breed betwixt courser and bird,
    Keeping pace with foot and with wing.

  The bird of the desert is he,
    The ostrich of beautiful plume,
  Skimming earth, as a swallow the sea,
    Or an eagle the lofty blue dome.

  He laughs at the speed of the hind,
    For pursuers he feels no concern,
  He travels ahead of the wind,
    And leaves the dull lightning astern.

THE PLOWMAN.


  Turn up the generous soil--
    'Tis rich in hidden wealth,
  And well repays your earnest toil
    With plenty, peace, and health.

  Plow with a bold, strong hand--
    Drive deep the glittering share;
  No surface-scratching will command
    Earth's treasures rich and rare.

  Then, if you'd freely reap,
    With bounteous freedom sow--
  And while you wake, and while you sleep,
    The precious grain will grow.




ON A GOOD HOUSE-DOG CALLED "WATCH."


  Poor faithful Watch! thy watch of life is o'er,
  And mute and senseless near the kitchen door
  Thou lay'st, a breathless corpse, where thou stood to guard before;
  Thy pliant temper, known and praised by all,
  Thy prompt obedience to thy master's call;
  Whether to climb the hill, or scour the plain,
  Or drive encroaching hogs from out the lane;
  Thy quick return, on motion of his hand,
  To guard the door, or wait a fresh command;
  Thy joy to meet at eve, with fawning play,
  Domestic faces, absent but a day;
  Thy bark, that might the boldest thief affright,
  And patient watch through many a dreary night--
  All speak thy worth, but none could save thy breath,
  For what is merit 'gainst the shafts of Death?
  Sleep, then, my dog! thy tour of duty o'er,
  Where thief and trav'ler can disturb no more;
  Content t' have gained all that thou now canst have--
  Thy master's plaudit and a peaceful grave!

GONE--ALL GONE!


  By the bubbling fount 'mid the greenwood shades,
  In the leafy world of the forest glades,
  No more the birds, at the blush of morn,
  Trill their sweet notes; they are gone--all gone!

  Voices of summer, I've listed long
  For the witching strains of your matin song;
  Through the woodland dim, o'er the rustling lawn,
  I have sought you oft; but you're gone--all gone?

  No more do you start in your still retreat
  At the thundering tramp of the horses' feet,
  Or the wandering note of the bugle horn;
  But the woods are mute, for you're gone--all gone!

  'Mid the wild wood's haunts, through your lonely nests,
  The rude winds play, and the snow-wreath rests
  In their yielding curve, while in jeering scorn
  The cold blast whistles, "Gone--all gone!"

  They say that ye sing 'neath a sunnier arch
  Of the azure skies, where the seasons' march
  Brings but one endless vernal dawn;
  But my heart is sad, for you're gone--all gone!

THE CHRISTMAS TREE.


      The Christmas tree!
      The Christmas tree!
  O gather around it now;
      Its fruits are free
      For you and for me,
  And they hang from every bough.

      Its flowers are bright,
      And they grew in a night,
  For yesterday it was bare
      Did ever you see
      An evergreen tree
  So fruitful and so fair?

      Look! here is a rose!
      And who would suppose
  An orange and a pear
      Would grow by the side
      Of the garden's pride?
  But here, you see, they are.

      And, stranger yet,
      Here's a bon-bon, set
  On the same identical stem,
      With two plums, so big
      That a neighboring fig
  Seems lost in the shadow of them.

      And here, what's this?
      As I live, 'tis a kiss,
  And just where a kiss should be;
      A tulip full blown,
      Hard by it is shown--
  Indeed, 'tis a wonderful tree.

      Here, bravo! I've found
      MERRY'S MUSEUM, bound--
  This must be the Tree of Knowledge;
      Besides which, behold!
      All lettered in gold,
  A poem fresh out from the college.

      Hold! hold! my good sirs,
      Here's a nice set of furs--
  'Tis a fir-tree, you all must agree;
      And here, not _incog._,
      Is a sweet sugar-hog--
  Does that make a mahogany-tree?

      Oh! who would have guessed?
      Here's a nice little chest,
  Of course 'tis a chestnut-tree;
      Not so fast, cousin Knox,
      Here's a beautiful box--
  A box-tree it surely must be.

      Your proof something lacks,
      For here is an ax.
  You must own 'tis an axle-tree now;
      Hallo! here's a whip,
      For your horsemanship--
  'Tis a whipple-tree, then, you'll allow.

      What now shall be said?
      Here are needles and thread--
  Let's see--shall we call it tre-mend(o)us?
      Oh, pshaw! pray do stop,
      I'm ready to drop--
  Your puns are absurdly stupendous.

MY MOTHER'S BIRTHPLACE.


  It was just outside of the village,
    In a cool, sequestered nook,
  On the right was the murmuring forest,
    On the left was the babbling brook.
  Behind, the o'ershadowing mountain
    Reared its gray old head to the sky,
  While before it, the widening valley
    Stretched out like a sea to the eye.

  'Twas a rare, sweet spot, and a lovely
    As ever this fair world knew;
  There spring came earliest always,
    And summer the latest withdrew.
  Day reluctantly left it at evening,
    And hastened to greet it at dawn,
  And stars, birds, and flowers loved to visit
    THE PLACE WHERE MY MOTHER WAS BORN.




THE SONG OF BOB LINCOLN.

BY UNCLE TIM.


  It was a beautiful morning, quite early in May,
  The fathers all plowing, the children all play;
  The mothers all spinning, as busy as bees,
  And the birds quite as busy all round in the trees;
  While some were singing songs over and over,
  Sometimes in the tree-tops, then down in the clover,
  Young Robert was trying his very best notes,
  And the strength of his song by the length of his throat.

  CHORUS--Envy me, envy me,
          Cordially, cordially,
          Fiddlesticks, fiddlesticks!
          Just act your pleasure, sir.

  Sometimes he was singing to Jemmy the farmer,
  And then to Miss Alice, and trying to charm her;
  Next moment he'd light on the top of a thistle,
  And either be singing or trying to whistle:
  Miss Alice, Miss Alice! it will give me much pleasure
  To sing you a sonnet while I am at leisure.
  I will sing you a good one, and very explicit,
  And stop when I choose, or whenever you wish it.

  CHORUS--Certainly, certainly, etc.

  While Jemmy is plowing and learning to whistle,
  My wife is at home, in the shade of a thistle,
  In a neat little nest, with a wild rose behind it.
  You need not look for it, for you never can find it.
  The farmer is plowing, and soon will be mowing;
  While he's cutting the daisies his corn will be growing.
  When the heads on the barley are ripe, and the cherry,
  Mary Lincoln and I will be singing so merry.

  CHORUS--Cordially, cordially,
          Envy me, envy me,
          Fiddlesticks, fiddlesticks!
          Just act your pleasure, sir.

  When the leaves on the trees and the flowers on the clover
  Are withered and faded, and Summer is over;
  When the grass on the meadows is leveled and gone,
  We will sing our last sonnet and leave you alone.
  We will fly far away to the rice and the cotton;
  But let not our thistle and rose be forgotten.
  We are certain to come again early in Spring,
  And bring some choice music, which we promise to sing.

  CHORUS--Cordially, cordially,
          Envy me, envy me,
          Fiddlesticks, fiddlesticks!
          Just act your pleasure, sir.

A WILL AND A WAY.


  A Lapland merchant must needs, one day,
    To a distant market go;
  But he had no horse, and he had no sleigh,
    To carry him over the snow.

  "Yet go I must," said the sturdy man--
    "There is a way for every will--
  Each new necessity has its plan,
    For the earnest mind to fulfill."

  So he drew, from the ice-bound river, a scow,
    And lined it with furs and moss,
  Then harnessed a reindeer to its prow,
    With a rope his horns across.

  No track was there--but the traveler knew
    The way over valley and plain;
  Like a well-trained steed, the reindeer flew,
    And brought him safe back again.

  The fashion he set is in fashion now,
    Among the fur-clad Norse;
  They use for a sleigh a flat-bottomed scow,
    And a reindeer for a horse.

  Said the resolute man, "They shall serve my turn;
    Whatever we must, we may,
  And sooner or later each man will learn,
    That _where there's a will there's a way_."

BLOWING BUBBLES.


  The boys were blowing bubbles,
    Bright red, and green, and blue,
  And every changing color
    That ever mortal knew.
  They floated in the window,
    And glided past my chair,
  But in a moment perished,
    And faded in the air.

  The boys, with shouts and laughter,
    Blew till quite out of breath,
  While high in the leafy maple
    The bubbles gleamed till death.
  Too much like earthly pleasure
    Seemed the bubbles, bright and gay;
  They charm a fleeting moment,
    Then vanish, away--away.

  Sweet love's ecstatic potion
    Our spirits long to sip,
  But Death may dash the nectar
    From the unsullied lip.
  And he who quaffs the longest,
    Whose heart divinely glows,
  Finds clouds will gather round him,
    For earthly joys must close.

  Some grasp at wealth's bright beacon,
    And follow where it leads--
  Sometimes to fairest honor,
    Sometimes to foulest deeds
  And often proves a bubble,
    A floating thing of air--
  Eludes the weary victim,
    And leaves him starving there.

  If love's so frail a treasure,
    And wealth may fade away;
  If earthly joys are changing,
    And fame lives but a day;
  Then where are shining jewels
    That will not break at last,
  And leave us, eager viewers,
    All mourning for the past?

  High in the holy heavens,
    A pearl of price untold
  Shines brighter far than rubies,
    More precious than fine gold.
  It can not fade or perish,
    Can never pass away;
  It is a hope in Jesus,
    A trust in God alway!

AFTER SCHOOL.


  Just look upon that group of boys,
  Brim full of frolic, spunk, and noise,
  When, at the word, "The school is done,"
  They rush to liberty and fun.

  Pell-mell, they run, and jump, and leap,
  Tumbling in one promiscuous heap,
  Until you wonder by what token
  They 'scape with heads and limbs unbroken.

  Bold, reckless, cunning, cool, or sly,
  What won't they do? what won't they try?
  They're up to every kind of scheme,
  To test their strength, and let off steam.

  'Tis an epitome of life,
  Without its shades of care and strife;
  Each has his private joke, and cracks it,
  Regardless how the other takes it.

  And there's the point--boys take rough jokes
  More pleasantly than older folks,
  Not heeding much what's said or done,
  So they can have their fill of fun.




THE NIGHTINGALE.


  Sweet bird! that through the shadows
    Of the night, so sad and lone,
  Warblest thy notes of gladness,
    With softly thrilling tone.

  'Tis when the gloom is deepest,
    And all is hushed in fear,
  Save that night-winds are moaning
    Through the stillness dark and drear;

  'Tis then thy voice is sweetest,
    And seems wafted from above,
  As to the sad and sorrowing
    Come words of hope and love.

  Thou'rt heard within the casement,
    Through the weary night of pain;
  And thy warble is an earnest
    That the day will come again.

  Methinks thou art a spirit-bird,
    Sent from a holier sphere;
  Such spirits do not linger
    Amidst the sorrowing here.

LEAP-FROG.


  That's right, Benny, go it strong,
  Go it high, and go it long,
  Swiftly run, and boldly leap,
  Froggy Charles is quite a heap.

  Charley Frog, now take your jump;
  Benny, make yourself a lump;
  'Tis a wholesome sport and rare--
  Rest and toil an equal share.

  Now you're down, and now you're up;
  Now you leap, and now you stoop;
  Now you rest, and now you run;
  Any way, 'tis right good fun.




A WORLD OF LOVE AT HOME.


  The earth hath treasures fair and bright,
    Deep buried in her caves,
  And ocean hideth many a gem
    With his blue, curling waves;
  Yet not within her bosom dark,
    Or 'neath the dashing foam,
  Lives there a treasure equaling
    A world of love at home!

  True, sterling happiness and joy
    Are not with gold allied,
  Nor can it yield a pleasure like
    A merry fireside.
  I envy not the man who dwells
    In stately hall or dome,
  If, 'mid his splendor, he hath not
    A world of love at home.

  The friends whom time hath proved sincere,
    'Tis they alone can bring
  A sure relief to hearts that droop
    'Neath sorrow's heavy wing.
  Though care and trouble may be mine,
    As down life's path I roam,
  I'll heed them not while still I have
    A world of love at home.

I MUST HASTEN HOME.


  I must hasten home, said a rosy child,
    Who had gayly roamed for hours;
  I must hasten home to my mother dear--
    She will seek me amid the bowers.
  If she chides, I will seal her lips with a kiss,
    And offer her all my flowers.

  I must hasten home, said a beggar girl,
    As she carried the pitiful store
  Of crumbs and scraps of crusted bread,
    She had gathered from door to door;
  I must hasten home to my mother dear--
    She is feeble, and old, and poor!

  I must hasten home, said the ball-room belle,
    As day began to dawn;
  And the glittering jewels her dark hair decked,
    Shone bright as the dews of morn;
  I'll forsake the joys of this changing world,
    Which leave in the heart but a thorn.

  I must hasten home, said a dying youth,
    Who had vainly sought for fame--
  Who had vowed to win a laurel wreath,
    And immortalize his name;
  But, a stranger, he died on a foreign shore--
    All the hopes he had cherished were vain.

  I am hastening home, said an aged man,
    As he gazed on the grassy sod,
  Where oft, ere age had silvered his hairs,
    His feet had lightly trod;
  Farewell! farewell to this lovely earth--
    I am hastening home to God!

THE EVENING PRAYER.


  With meek and simple faith,
      A child's confiding love,
  The infant cherub kneels to breathe
      His prayer to God above.
  And all the host of heaven is there,
  To listen to that infant prayer.

  "God, bring dear father home,
      God, make dear mother well,
  God, make me good, and let us come
      All in Thy house to dwell."
  Then, while their watch good angels keep,
  "God giveth His beloved sleep."




ACROSTIC.


  Roses and tulips, with all their gay train,
  O'er garden and landscape cause beauty to reign.
  By the brook, or the hillside, or light woody grove,
  Enchanted--delighted--on, smiling, we rove;
  'Rapt up in fond thoughts of the verdure and bloom,
  'Till autumn's cold frost sweeps the whole to the tomb.

  My emotions, when life seems thus passing and vain,
  Even wisdom and prudence can hardly restrain.
  Rude winter now comes, and with sleet, hail, and snow,
  Right and left sends his arrows, as shivering we go.
  Yet I see there's a chance, even _now_, to be cheery,
  Sitting snug by the fire, with old _Robert Merry_.

  My cosy old friend, no winter is found
  Unfurled in thy pages the whole season round!
  Still birds sing their songs in some warm, sunny clime,
  Ever speaking in music and talking in rhyme;
  Unless you may tell us some odd tale that's true,
  Making all of us merry, _Old Merry_, with you!

OUR NEBBY.


  Sure I am, I do not know
  Why we love our Nebby so;
  But I am sure, as sure can be,
  Nebby knows why he loves me.
  Mattie feeds Neb every day,
  And 'tis as good as any play,
  Just to see his pranks and freaks,
  When to Nebby Mattie speaks.
  When I go home from the store,
  Nebby meets me at the door,
  And says, most eloquently dumb,
  "Nebby's glad that you have come."
  Nebby is a little pet;
  Nebby don't know how to fret;
  But he knows the tenderest part
  Of our Mattie's tender heart.




THE NEW SONG.


  Whence that sweet, inspiring strain,
    Pealing on my ravished ear?
  Hark! its thrilling notes again
    From the courts of heaven I hear--
  "Hallelujah to the Lamb,
    Who hath bought us with His blood!
  Honor, glory to His name,
    We through Him are sons of God."
  Angels fain their notes would join
    With that vast, triumphant song;
  But _their_ harps, though all divine,
    Ne'er can reach that wondrous song
  Learned on earth, and new in heaven,
    Only they its chords can know
  Who to God by grace are given,
    Ransomed from the depths of wo.
  Angels can not know or tell,
    In their pure, unfallen bliss,
  How a soul, redeemed from hell,
    Sings the mystery of grace!
  They the chosen, countless throng,
    Ever round the throne above,
  In their new and endless song,
    Celebrate redeeming love.




[Illustration]


THE CHINAMAN.


  The Chinaman his life consumes,
    On opium regaling--
  The Yankee his tobacco fumes
    With equal zest inhaling--
  Though trembling nerves and fitful glooms
    Warn them that health is failing.
  For almost everything that's done
    Some reason wit supposes,
  But for the smoker's faith, not one
    The keenest wit discloses;
  'Tis filthy, vulgar, costly fun,
    Hateful to all good noses.




[Illustration]


AN INDIAN DANDY.


  Well, isn't that a funny dress?
    You think he must be cruel,
  With human bones set round his crown,
    And skulls in place of jewels.

  Yet in his countenance you see
    Nothing severe or savage,
  As if, with cannibal intent,
    Our whole domain he'd ravage.

  There's no accounting for our tastes,
    ("_De gustibus_," and so forth;)
  Some dote on very slender waists,
    Some like hooped cisterns go forth.

  Sneer not at Indian or Malay,
    Nor get into a passion;
  He does as you do day by day--
    Follows the latest fashion.

  White dandies strut in stove-pipe hats,
    White women go bare-headed;
  Which is most proper, red or white,
    We leave in doubt deep shaded.

[Illustration]




THE SHADOW.


  One sunny day a child went Maying--
  When lo, while 'mid the zephyrs playing,
  He saw his shadow at his back!
  He turned and fled, but on his track
  The seeming goblin came apace,
  And step for step gave deadly chase!

  Weary at last, with desperate might
  The urchin paused and faced the fright,
  When lo, the demon, thin and gray,
  Faded amid the grass away!

  'Tis thus in life--when shadows chase,
  If we but meet them face to face,
  What seemed a fiend in fear arrayed,
  Sinks at our feet a harmless shade.

  PETER PARLEY.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
